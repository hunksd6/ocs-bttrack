This bittorrent tracker was extracted and modified from BitTornado,
and is specially used for Clonezilla SE.

Thomas Tsai added two options for bttrack:
as ocs-bttrack:
--tracker_timeout <arg>
          Time to stop tracker (defaults to 0)

--tracker_max_completed <arg>
          Stop tracker via count of transfer completed (defaults to 0)

The program was renamed as ocs-bttrack.

The upstream source was obtained from http://bittornado.com/download.html
and was written by John Hoffman <theshadow _at_ degreez net>
